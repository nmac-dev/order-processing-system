## Scenario
Each customer places multiple orders during each day.  
At the end of each day the orders are collatedand each customer’s total order quantity is sent to them as a single shipment.  
If a customer placesan “express” order, then it and all its outstanding orders for the day are sent immediately (i.e.  notwaiting for the end of the day).  
When a shipment is triggered for a customer, they are notified that a shipment is on its way, andan invoice is sent to them.
